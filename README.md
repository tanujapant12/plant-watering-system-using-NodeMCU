discription
Overview
An IOT based Irrigation system using the ESP8266 NodeMCU module and DHT11 sensor. It will not only irrigate the water based on the moisture level in the soil but also send the data to BLYNK Application to keep track of the land condition.
OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT
India is regarded as the country of orchards and farmers. Around 50% of the population of our country relies on agriculture and related activities in one or the other way to support their livelihood (while 22% solely on agriculture). Agriculture plays an important role by contributing 16% to the countryâ€™s total GDP. Therefore, agricultural demands should be thoroughly analyzed and managed as their wastage use would affect future needs. Agricultural sector requires a lot of irrigational water. Water supply to the crop fields should be made judicially, as less water leads to crop crash, whereas abundant water supply can even destroy them. The main objective is Automatic Plant watering monitoring system using NodeMCU
